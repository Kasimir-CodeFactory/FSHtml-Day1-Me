        <p>I know I f- up, I'm just a loser<br>
        Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter<br>
        While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'<br>
        'Bout where I should've been<br>
        I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah<br><br></p>
        <p>Water pouring down from the ceiling<br>
        I knew this would happen, still hard to believe it<br>
        Maybe I'm dramatic, I don't wanna seem it<br>
        I don't wanna panic<br><br></p>
        <p>I'm a sad girl, in this big world<br>
        It's a mad world<br>
        All of my friends<br>
        Know what's happened<br>
        You're a bad thing<br><br></p>
        <p>I know I f- up, I'm just a loser<br>
        Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter<br>
        While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'<br>
        'Bout where I should've been<br>
        I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah<br><br></p>
        <p>La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la<br>
        Lonely (I'm a lonely chic)<br>
        La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la<br>
        Lonely (Supalonely)<br><br></p>
